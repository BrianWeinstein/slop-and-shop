# Slop & Shop
Another vertical video, snap-scrolling, content consumption app. But for a cause!

**![](/public/screenshots/screenshots.png)**

A few weeks ago, I was hypnotically scrolling through a vertical video, snap-scrolling, content consumption app when I encountered a bug: every video in my infinite feed was a “sponsored” post trying to get me to buy something.

That same week, there was a new app gaining attention: a vertical video, snap-scrolling, content consumption app in which every video was AI-generated.

I paused for a moment and thought to myself, “Am I in hell?” I quickly decided to save that question for another day, then thought, “Why not an app that is… both?” So here, I’m embarrassed to announce my latest and dumbest creation yet: [**Slop & Shop**](https://brianweinstein.github.io/slop-and-shop/)**, a vertical video, snap-scrolling, content consumption app in which every video is an AI-generated advertisement that tries to get you to buy something**.

The app can only do two things: play AI-generated ads in an endless feed, and (plot twist\!) encourage you to **make our future less sloppy and less shoppy by donating to a few nonprofits committed to making high-quality, human-created knowledge available to the world, for free**.

[**Play around with the app**](https://brianweinstein.github.io/slop-and-shop/) for a minute, then please tap one of the “Shop now”/“Get offer”/“Sign up” buttons to donate to worthy causes.
